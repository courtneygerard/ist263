    <h1>Courtney's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a <strong>Communications Design major</strong> interested in product design and advertising. I have experience in adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Illustrator. I won the title of Long Island's Best Young Artist for photography in 2020. My hobbies include snowboarding and traveling. My favorite tv shows are New Girl and Gilmore Girls but I also love any show on HGTV. I also love watching the weather channel and I get really excited when they are reporting on a major storm. Harry Potter is my favorite book series and I have read all 7 books in a little less than a month. A weird fact about me is that I love airports.</p>
