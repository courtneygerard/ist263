    <h2>Natural Selection Tour</h2>
    <p>
        The Natural Selection Tour is the first unconventional winter sports competition to include Olympians and big mountain film riders. Competitors compete on the most beautiful, raw, and challenging terrain. The first week of the tour took place in Jackson Hole on February 3rd to the 9th. The best snowboarders in the world competed in the deepest powder ever. Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took the first place title for the women and Mark McMorris for the men. T- Bird and Jeff Moran said “This event allowed people to see more aspects of snowboarding. This is what we all know and love about snowboarding. It makes me feel warm inside to know that what we experience as a culture can now be experienced in a really engaging way by people who are not necessarily directly involved in snowboarding. They get to see what it is about our lifestyle, our culture and our community that’s so strong.” The next stop is Baldface Mountain in Canada. The tour and to make some alterations due to covid restrictions. 10 new athletes will be paired up with a videographer in the backcountry of Canada.
